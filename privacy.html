				<p>Hello, and welcome to our Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy helps
				you to make informed decisions about your relationship with us, so
				please read it carefully. We hope you're sitting comfortably in a
				boring lecture. Here we go...</p>
				<h2><a id="s1"></a>1 Introduction</h2>
				<p>The Privacy Policy is here to do three things:</p>
				<ol>
						<li>Explain the way we use information that you share with us in
						order to build a great product and give you a great experience with
						it;</li>
						<li>Ensure that you understand what information we collect with
						your permission, and what we do -- and do not do -- with it;</li>
						<li>Hold us accountable for protecting your rights and your privacy
						under this policy.</li>
				</ol>
				<p><strong>All the information we collect is related to providing MCU
				App and its features.</strong></p>
				<p>Broadly speaking, there are two categories of information we
				collect: 1) information that we must have in order for you to use MCU
				App; and 2) information that we can use to provide additional features
				and improve our application accordingly; and 3) information that helps
				us conduct studies on Medical Education.</p>
				<p>The first category includes:</p>
				<ul>
						<li>Registration information, which includes your student ID only.
						Your MCU password, for example, will remain only on your
						device.</li>
						<li>The lessons you are required to attend and related information.
						This allows us to complete our extensive database on tutors,
						lectures, and student satisfaction with them.</li>
						<li>Technical and sensor information necessary to operate MCU App.
						This includes the type of device you use, data from the
						touchscreen, and information from your device's accelerometer and
						gyroscope sensors. This enables you to control MCU App and allows
						us to do simple things like providing timely alerts and/or
						determining the best time to ask for your opinion.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The second category includes information that enables us to offer
				you additional features. We automatically enable sharing of such
				information upon install, but you are able to opt out while keep on
				using the app. Here are some examples:</p>
				<ul>
						<li>Your specific location: This information enables us to create
						collaborative learning experiences (only with others who have also
						given permission).</li>
						<li>Your app usage pattern: This includes information on frequently
						accessed pages, duration of app usage, settings, and frequency of
						using each function provided by the App.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The distinction between these two categories is important.
				Information in the first category is information you must provide in
				order to use MCU App. When you agree to our Privacy Policy, you give us
				the right to collect this information and use it for the purposes
				described. Information in the second category is information we will
				stop collecting if you explicitly choose to.</p>
				<p>For the third category, we are collecting information to further
				improve medical education in CUHK via different quantitative and
				qualitative case studies. We will prompt you regularly for comments and
				ratings on specific lectures, tutorials, or teachers. We will collect
				these information on a anonymous basis with all identifiable personal
				information obfuscated before publication.</p>
				<p><strong>We will be clear with you about how and when we might share
				information.</strong></p>
				<hr>
				<p>We hope this helps you to understand our privacy commitments to you.
				Now, the details await you below, but please remember that this
				Introduction is part of the Privacy Policy itself -- it's our promise to
				you. If you ever have any questions or concerns, then please let us
				know at <a href="mailto:mkcyyin@gmail.com">mkcyyin@gmail.com</a>.</p>
				<p>Throughout this Privacy Policy we refer to the MCU App or the
				App.</p>
				<h2><a id="s2"></a>2 Key highlights of what you're consenting to</h2>
				<p>By using or interacting with the App, you are consenting to:</p>
				<ol>
						<li>the collection, use, sharing, and other processing of your
						information, including for research-related purposes (as described
						in the rest of this Privacy Policy, so please keep on reading!);
						and</li>
						<li>the public availability of your information and the controls
						over such information as described in <a href="#s5">Sharing
						information</a>.
						</li>
				</ol>
				<p>In each case, you consent to the processing of data by the entities
				described in this Privacy Policy, including the MCU App developer, as
				data controller, indicated at the bottom of this document
				(collectively, "we", "us", "our"). In the <a href="#s6">Your
				Preferences</a> section, we describe the controls and relevant settings
				associated with your MCU App account. If you don't agree with the terms
				of this Privacy Policy, then please don't use the App.</p>
				<h2><a id="s3"></a>3 The information we collect</h2>
				<p>We may collect and store the following information--</p>
				<h3>3.1 Registration data</h3>
				<p>When you sign up for the Service, we may ask you for information
				such as your student ID.</p>
				<h3><a id="s3-2"></a>3.2 Usage &amp; log data</h3>
				<p>When you use or interact with the App, we may use a variety of
				technologies that collect information about how the App is accessed and
				used. This information may include:</p>
				<ol>
						<li>information about your subscribed lessons and your interactions
						with the App, such as interactions with events, lecture notes,
						products, and services which are offered, linked to, or made
						available on or through the App;</li>
						<li>the details of the queries you make and the date and time of
						your request;</li>
						<li>User Content you post to the App including comments
						you send and/or view via the App;
						</li>
						<li>technical data, which may include device information, your IP
						address, unique device ID, device attributes, network connection
						type (e.g., WiFi, 3G, LTE), network and device performance,
						language, information enabling calendar event management, operating
						system, and MCU App version.</li>
						<li>motion-generated or orientation-generated mobile sensor data
						(e.g., accelerometer or gyroscope).</li>
				</ol>
				<h3>3.3 Your mobile device</h3>
				<p>We may provide features that rely on the use of additional
				information on your mobile device or require access to certain services
				on your mobile device that will enhance your MCU App experience but are
				not required to use the Service. (In other words, information that
				falls in the second and third category described in the Introduction to
				this Policy.) Granting us access does not mean you are granting us
				unlimited access to that information or that we will access specific
				information without your permission. You do not have to give us such
				permission in order to use MCU App, and you will have the right to
				revoke access to the second category of information.</p>
				<p>BY ACCEPTING THE PRIVACY POLICY, YOU EXPRESSLY AUTHORISE MCU APP TO
				USE AND SHARE WITH ITS DEVELOPER, AS WELL AS CERTAIN TRUSTED
				INDIVIDUALS, WHICH MAY NOT BE STUDENTS OF CUHK FACULTY OF MEDICINE. YOU
				ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE TO THE IMPORTANCE OF SHARING SUCH INFORMATION FOR
				THE PROVISION OF THE MCU APP AND ALSO AGREE THAT, BY ACCEPTING THIS
				PRIVACY POLICY, WHERE APPLICABLE AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
				APPLICABLE LAW, YOU EXPRESSLY WAIVE YOUR RIGHTS WITH REGARD TO US, ANY
				RELATED RESEARCH PERSONNEL AND ANY TRUSTED INDIVIDUALS, WHICH MAY NOT
				BE STUDENTS OF CUHK FACULTY OF MEDICINE. THIS CONSENT IS GIVEN FOR THE
				DURATION OF INSTALLATION OF MCU APP.</p>
				<h2><a id="s4"></a>4 How we use the information we collect</h2>
				<p>Consistent with the permissions you give us to collect the
				information, we may use the information we collect, including your
				personal information:</p>
				<ol>
						<li>to provide, personalise, and improve your experience with the
						App and products, services</li>
						<li>to ensure technical functionality of the App, develop new
						functions and services, and analyse your use of the App, including
						your interaction with functions and services that are made
						available, linked to, or offered through the App;</li>
						<li>to communicate with you for Service-related or research
						purposes including notifications or other messages;</li>
						<li>to communicate with you, either directly or through application
						notifications, for personal opinion and comments consistent with
						any permissions you may have communicated to us (e.g., through your
						MCU App settings); in the section <a href="#s6">Your
						preferences</a> below, we inform you of the controls you can use to
						opt out from receiving certain messages;
						</li>
						<li>to enable and promote the App and other services or products,
						either within or outside the App, including features and content of
						the App and products and services made available through the
						App;</li>
						<li>to enforce this Privacy Policy and any other terms that you
						have agreed to, including to protect the rights, property, or
						safety of MCU App, its users, or any other person, or the
						copyright-protected content of the App;</li>
						<li>to provide you with features, information, or other content
						which is influenced by your location and your location in relation
						to other users; and</li>
						<li>as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy.</li>
				</ol>
				<h2><a id="s5"></a>5 Sharing information</h2>
				<p>This section describes how the information collected or generated
				through your use of the SMU service may be shared by you or by us.</p>
				<h3><a id="s5-1"></a>5.1 Sharing by you</h3>
				<h4>5.1.1 Generally</h4>
				<p>The MCU App is a learning application that offers many ways to view
				and share content. We encourage you to take advantage of these social
				features with others on the App.</p>
				<p>Your name and/or student ID, will not be publicly available. All
				information you submit will be displayed anonymously in the system.</p>
				<p>What you post, comment, or upload to the App will remain publicly
				available. Please consider removing identifiable personal information
				before posting, commenting or uploading.</p>
				<p>Learn more about how to manage notifications and what you share with
				others in <a href="#s6">Your preferences</a> below.</p>
				<h3><a id="s5-2"></a>5.2 Sharing by us</h3>
				<h4>5.2.1 Research</h4>
				<p>We may share information with research partners in order to conduct
				educational research. The information we share is in a de-identified
				format (for example, through the use of hashing) that does not
				personally identify you.</p>
				<h2><a id="s6"></a>6 Your preferences</h2>
				<p>We provide you with settings to allow you to choose which
				communications you receive from us and set your sharing preferences.
				However, as explained in the section <a href="#s5-1">Sharing by
				you</a>, certain information may always be publicly available to others
				and other information is made publicly available to others by
				default.</p>
				<p>To change whether certain information is publicly available, you can
				adjust the settings in your app.</p>
				<h2><a id="s7"></a>7 Security</h2>
				<p>We are committed to protecting our users' information. While we take
				data protection precautions, no security measures are completely
				secure, and we do not guarantee the security of user information.</p>
				<h2><a id="s8"></a>8 Changes to the Privacy Policy</h2>
				<p>Occasionally we may, in our discretion, make changes to the
				Agreements. When we make material changes to the Agreements, we'll
				provide you with prominent notice as appropriate under the
				circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the App or
				by sending you a push notification. In some cases, we will notify you
				in advance, and your continued use of the App after the changes have
				been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes. Please
				therefore make sure you read any such notice carefully. If you do not
				wish to continue using the App under the new version of the Agreements,
				you may terminate the Agreements by removing the application from your
				device.</p>
				<p>Thank you for reading our Privacy Policy. We hope you enjoy the
				App!</p>
